I'm from Baltimore, Maryland and I study Mathematical Business at Wake Forest University. I chose Math Business because I excel in environments that require analytical thinking, and I'm most interested in financial services. If given the opportunity, I would enjoy working for a firm that allows me to explore the intersection of financial data and analytical thinking.
